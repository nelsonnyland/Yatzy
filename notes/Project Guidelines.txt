The goal will be to create a Yahtzee game. An example can be found above.
Part of this project will be to understand the rules of Yahtzee and then 
try to implement them in JavaScript/TypeScript.

I will be looking for the minimum functionality listed below:
- 5 die are present on the page
- Each die can be held and there is a visual indication of the state 
  (border around the held die, text of "held", etc.)
- The die can be rolled, but only non-held die get new values
- Die values should be 1 - 6 (standard die)
- The 5 dice values can be applied for points on the standard Yahtzee scorecard
- Once all spots on the score card are taken, the total amount of points is displayed

Some possible optional enhancements:
- Make this project object-oriented with a Player and ScoreCard class
- Provide an animation for dice roll
- Allow multiple players in a single game
- Display possible points on the score card for a given dice roll and remaining 
  score card spots
